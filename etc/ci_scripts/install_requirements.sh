# This is a placeholder for installing or updating dependencies in our CI
# (GitHub) runners when needed. A list of software versions installed on our
# runners can be found at
# https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md.
#
# This was used in the past to recent versions of software, without having to
# wait for GitHub to update the runners.
#
# As we use this script for updating software versions (not installing software
# in the first place), we should make note of the version we require and create
# a housekeeping issue for future cleanup to follow up once the CI runners
# incluse the version(s) we require.
